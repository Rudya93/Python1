# There are 3 types of employee: developer, designer and manager
# Each employee has: first name, second name, salary, experiance (years) and manager
# Each designer has effectivness coefficient(0-1)
# Each manager has team of developers and designers.
# Department should have list of managers(which have their own teams)
# Department should be able to give salary (for each employee message: "@firstName@ @secondName@: got salary: @salaryValue@")
# Each employee gets the salary, defined in field Salary. If experiance of employee is > 2 years, he gets bonus + 200$, if experiance is > 5 years, he gets salary*1.2 + bonus 500
# Each designer gets the salary = salary*effCoeff
# Each manager gets salary +
#
#
# 200$ if his team has >5 members
# 300$ if his team has >10 members
# salary*1.1 if more than half of team members are developers.

#
# Redefine string representation for employee as follows: "@firstName@ @secondName@, manager:@manager secondName@, experiance:@experiance@"
